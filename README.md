# Final-Year-Project
This project was an inquiry into whether facial matching and OCR can correctly identify a person from the passport they provided and ensure the person is over 18. Underage drinking has always been a problem in Ireland and with new technology we can find ways of preventing this happening inside registered establishments. It can be hard for a bouncer to correctly identify a person from their ID but through the use of facial recognition there is a way of ensuring that the person is definitely who they say they are, and this is what this project is aiming to accomplish. With the roll out of a project like this, it could also become a feature in off licenses and shops as long as some improvements are made.
